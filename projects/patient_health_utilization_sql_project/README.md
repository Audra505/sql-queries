## Project Overview 

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This project analyzes **synthetic patient health records** generated using the **Synthea Open Dataset**, a realistic simulation of U.S. healthcare data.  
The objective was to perform **end-to-end SQL analysis** in **PostgreSQL** â€” from raw data preparation and cleaning to exploratory queries that uncover trends in **patient demographics, healthcare utilization, chronic conditions, and immunization patterns**.  

These insights will be visualized in a **Power BI dashboard** to demonstrate real-world healthcare analytics.  

### Project Goals  
Through this analysis, I explored questions such as:
- Which demographics experience the most healthcare encounters?
- What are the most common and chronic health conditions?
- Which cities have higher chronic disease prevalence?
- How do immunization rates vary by age group?
- What is the overall utilization rate across patients?
